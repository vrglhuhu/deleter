_I am Chean Bernard V. Vergel.Â  I am 18 years old and currently I am a Second year college student taking my Bachelors' degree in Computer EngineeringÂ at Polytechnic University of the Philippines.Â  I believe that technology is something that has completely changed the way we live today and I amÂ excited to be part of this ever-evolving world.Â  A famous quote I always like to keep in mind is "The only way to predict the future is to create it." - Abraham Lincoln._

# _**My Duplicate Deleter**_  

_Let this program would ask you some characters and then delete those have duplicate!_
>
# ðŸ’¢ðŸ’¢ _**Introduction**_ ðŸ’¢ðŸ’¢ 
> This Python code is a user-friendly tool that allows users to input strings, removes duplicate characters and digits, and provides a customized experience through text-based art and messages.

# ðŸ’¢ðŸ’¢ _**Features**_ ðŸ’¢ðŸ’¢ 
- > **RemoveDuplicates Class:** This class defines a method remove_chars that removes duplicate characters from a given input string while retaining only unique characters. It also ensures that digits are not included in the result.
- > The code prints a **welcome message in fancy text** using the pyfiglet module.
- > **Import Statements:** The program imports the RemoveDuplicates class from an external module named duplicate_remover and imports pyfiglet for creating text-based headers and footers.
- > **User Interaction:** The program begins by welcoming the user with an ASCII art message and asking for their name. It then provides a brief explanation of the program's purpose and asks if the user wants to continue.
- > **Main Logic:** If the user agrees to continue, the program prompts the user to input the number of strings they want to process and collects these strings. It applies the RemoveDuplicates method to each input string, removing duplicates and digits, and then displays the results.
- > **End Messages:** Depending on the user's response, the program either thanks the user for their time or displays a default farewell message.
